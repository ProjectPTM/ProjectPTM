Several new features include: User login, Cloudinary for image handling, test.js files, dropdown menu, Handlebars table templating, Handlebars partials and helpers, and use of a Feedgrabbr widget and a Google custom search engine.
<br/>
** Must have a polished frontend / UI
<br/>
** Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm
